# Decision-Making Project

This project explores different decision-making algorithms in Reinforcement Learning. It includes various implementations for environments and algorithms, such as Atari games with Deep Q Networks, HalfCheetah with TD3 and PPO, and Maze environments for Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with policy iteration and value iteration.

## Project Structure

- **Atari + DQN**: Implementation of Deep Q Network (DQN) for Atari environments.
- **HalfCheetah + TD3, PPO**: Contains implementations of Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the HalfCheetah environment.
- **MDP, Maze Environment**: Implementation of Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a maze environment.
- **Value Iteration + Policy Iteration**: Demonstrates Value Iteration and Policy Iteration algorithms for MDPs.
